# About this file

This is where the data generated by the
web-app / server combo will be stored.

It will be based on JSON files,
nothing fancy here, and homemade.

**So please do NOT touch anything in this directory**
**unless you know what you are doing**.

The main purpose of this readme is to let me
gitignore this folder
but still have it created upon cloning.

Better than a .gitkeep no?
